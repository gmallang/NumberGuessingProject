# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**! This is a simple Python game where the computer thinks of a random number, and you have to guess it. You can choose between two difficulty levels: easy and hard.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- **Difficulty Levels**: You can choose between two difficulty levels:
  - **Easy**: 10 attempts to guess the number.
  - **Hard**: 6 attempts to guess the number.
- **Feedback**: After each guess, you will receive feedback if your guess was too high or too low.
- **Game Over**: The game ends either when you guess the number correctly or run out of attempts.
